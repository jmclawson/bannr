# bannr

Using rvest and tidyverse tools, bannr helps course instructors get clean, actionable data on their courses, their students, and other information that can otherwise only be navigated via a web interface in the browser. From logging in to exporting attendance records, bannr's goal is to make it easy for instructors to use course data without needing to enter things by hand.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bannr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmclawson/bannr")
```

## Using the package

After installation, load the package with `library()`. Begin a session with `authorize()` and go from there.

```{r example1, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(bannr)
all_data <- authorize() |> 
  process_attendances()
```
