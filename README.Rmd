Using rvest and tidyverse tools, bannr helps instructors get clean, actionable data on their courses, their students, and other information that can otherwise only be retrieved via a web browser. From logging in to exporting rosters and attendance records, bannr's goal is to make it easy for instructors to access course data in clean digital formats.

## Installation

The latest version of bannr can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmclawson/bannr")
```

## Using the package

After installation, load the package with `library()`. Begin a session with `authorize()` and go from there.

```{r example1, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(bannr)
my_courses <- authorize() |> 
  get_course_table()
```
