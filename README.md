Using rvest and tidyverse tools, bannr helps course instructors get
clean, actionable data on their courses, their students, and other
information that can otherwise only be navigated via a web interface in
the browser. From logging in to exporting attendance records, bannrâ€™s
goal is to make it easy for instructors to use course data without
needing to enter things by hand.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bannr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jmclawson/bannr")
```

## Using the package

After installation, load the package with `library()`. Begin a session
with `authorize()` and go from there.

``` r
library(bannr)
all_data <- authorize() |> 
  process_attendances()
```
